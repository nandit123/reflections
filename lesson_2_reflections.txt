What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file is added, which  make it accessible for git features.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit. As long as a changeset is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you like (replace staged files with other versions of staged files, remove changes from staging, etc.).
