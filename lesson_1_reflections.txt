How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I got to know that lines having + at the start were added in the latest version and the one having - at start were removed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
We may forget to commit, and if system goes down later, loss of work will be there. Also, we may be committing too early or late also.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For proper functioning of interconnected files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives commit id, with message and then commit ids can be used to compare two file differences using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can easily go back and check bugs to make the things work again

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
for building my own website & apps.
